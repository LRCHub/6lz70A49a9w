# Fugitive – Spheres Of Virulence

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Warning signs
Suffocating skies
Death, it surrounds
Legion lost behind nation's walls
Scars of the past resume in the age of law

From the wrong world
Bred by boot and fist
From the wrong world
In spheres of virulence

Poisoned minds
Severing all ties
Threats to betray
Deified myopic visions
Carving out names of the opposed

From the wrong world
Bred by boot and fist
From the wrong world
In spheres of virulence

Unnatural decline
Left to die beneath the cross
Distorted dimensions exacting a price

Refuse without concession pacts
An inferno of delusion
With calloused hands and broken glass
Will to resist the undertow

In spheres of virulence
